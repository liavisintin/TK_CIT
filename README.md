# TK_CIT
_TK modelling for determination of the TK parameters of CIT_

This repository contains a mere application of the TK modelling algorithm developed by Prof. Weihsueh Chiu (Texas A&M University). The codes contained in the relative repository (https://github.com/wachiuphd/Mycotoxin-PK-model) were modified for the specific application to citrinin case in collaboration with the author. The experimental data used were obtained in the context of the ERC project HuMyco (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/946192).
